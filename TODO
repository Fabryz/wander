don't use player, store playerId and use on players array
|-> so it will be needed to hash id to avoid client hacks
refresh newnick on players client

ping clients and refresh playerlist
check for doublenick
player registration (use db)
+revise all the code
+optimize socket messages
+socket send on keypress?
socket movement only for who's not the player
use NowJS
readd map data structure and map rendering stuff
minify/obfuscate client code

+browser compatibility Chrome, FF, IE(?)
?move only on mod TILE_WIDTH, animation
optimize drawmap: render only viewable
*collision with walls (rewrite moveCanvas/movePlayer)
check clear canvas on player
dirty tiles to re-render
